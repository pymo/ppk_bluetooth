# Palm Portable Keyboard Bluetooth Adapter

This project is a DIY Bluetooth module for the Palm Portable Keyboards (PPK), so you can assemble it to your PPK and use it with any host that supports BLE (Bluetooth 4.0 and later).

Where to buy:

I've made some version 3 adapter for sale. Here is the link to the product: [https://www.tindie.com/products/26595/](https://www.tindie.com/products/26595/)

This project is inspired by [cy384](https://github.com/cy384/ppk_usb)'s USB PPK adapter, and [Christian](https://hackaday.io/project/181800-palm-pilot-keyboard-bluetooth-conversion)'s ESP32-based PPK bluetooth adapter. 

I've made 3 versions of the adapter: version 1 is based on an Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express board, version 2 is based on a LilyGo-T-OI-PLUS ESP32-C3 board. version 3 is based on my custom designed CH582F board. Here are the differences of these versions.

| version | Build Tutorial | Highlights | 
| :-------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------: | :------: |
| Version 1 | [Tutorial](version1_tutorial.md) | Based on an Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express board. Experimental, no longer supported. Hard to make. Expensive. Micro USB charging. |
| Version 2 | [Tutorial](version2_tutorial.md) | Based on a LilyGo-T-OI-PLUS ESP32-C3 board. Easy to build, cheap, power hungry, no USB HID support. Type-C charging. no longer supported. |
| Version 3 | [Tutorial](version3_tutorial.md) | Based on my custom designed PCB using CH582F chip. Easier to build, cheap, power efficient, USB HID support. Multi-host support. Type-C charging. |

version 3 is the current one I sell in my Tindie store. If you want to DIY and don't want to buy my board, you can choose version 2. version 1 is really old and no longer supported.
